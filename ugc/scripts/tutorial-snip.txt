Foreman: walkin’ here will require alternating medium pulses to the left and right leg respectively.

Foreman: Tappin’ a muscle neuron won’t do much — you’re gonna need to hold it down to charge it to the size of pulse ya want.

Foreman: That's a bit light. Dave's gonna need more oomph to get movin'.

> MotorStepOver
Foreman: Whoah, careful! Ya nearly sprained an ankle there.

> MotorStepTimeout
Foreman: You sleepin' in the job already? Try holdin' and then releasing some neurons to get those legs moving.

Foreman: Very nice, just like that.

Foreman: Perfect, keep it up.
